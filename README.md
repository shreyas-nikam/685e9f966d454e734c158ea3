# Streamlit Lab: Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction

## Project Title and Description

This Streamlit application is a lab project designed to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features like age, gender, class, and fare. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions and provides users with an interactive interface to explore different feature combinations and see their impact on the predicted survival probability.  This project serves as a demonstration of deploying machine learning models with Streamlit and allows users to gain insights into the factors that may have influenced survival rates on the Titanic.

## Features

*   **Interactive Input Forms:** Users can input passenger details through interactive Streamlit widgets (e.g., dropdowns, sliders, number inputs).
*   **Real-time Prediction:** The application makes a survival prediction based on the entered passenger features in real-time.
*   **Feature Exploration:** Users can experiment with different feature values to understand their impact on the predicted survival probability.
*   **Clear Output Display:** The predicted survival probability is clearly displayed, along with an interpretation of the result.
*   **Data Visualization (Optional):**  Future versions may include visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to explore the Titanic dataset.
*   **Model Explanation (Optional):**  Future versions may include tools to explain the model's prediction (e.g., feature importance).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:**  Python 3.7 or higher is recommended.  You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **pip:**  pip is the package installer for Python.  It usually comes with Python installations.  Verify its presence by running `pip --version` in your terminal.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your project's GitHub repository and `<repository_name>` with the name of the directory created by cloning.

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:

    *   **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   **On macOS and Linux:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command installs all the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.  Make sure the `requirements.txt` file is in the root of your project directory and contains all the necessary dependencies.  A sample `requirements.txt` is shown below.

    ```
    streamlit
    scikit-learn
    pandas
    numpy
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    Replace `app.py` with the actual name of your Streamlit application file if different.  This command will launch the application in your web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

2.  **Interact with the application:**

    *   Enter the passenger's details through the provided input forms (e.g., age, sex, class).
    *   Observe the predicted survival probability based on your input.
    *   Experiment with different feature combinations to explore their impact on the prediction.

```

*   `app.py`:  Contains the Streamlit application code, including the user interface and model prediction logic.
*   `model.pkl`: Stores the pre-trained machine learning model.  Pickling is a way to serialize Python objects.  This file is loaded when the application starts.  Consider using a different file extension and format, such as joblib.
*   `README.md`:  Provides information about the project, installation, usage, and more.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required to run the application.
*   `data/`: An optional directory to store data files related to the project. This can include the Titanic dataset or other relevant data.
*   `.gitignore`:  An optional file that specifies files and directories that Git should ignore (e.g., virtual environment folder, `.pyc` files, data files that are too large).

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **Streamlit:**  A Python library for creating interactive web applications with minimal code.
*   **Scikit-learn:**  A Python library for machine learning (used for building and training the prediction model).
*   **Pandas:** A Python library for data manipulation and analysis (used for reading and processing the Titanic dataset).
*   **NumPy:** A Python library for numerical computing (used for array manipulation and mathematical operations).
