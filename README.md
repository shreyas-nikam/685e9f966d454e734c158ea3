# Streamlit Lab: Interactive Data Visualization and Analysis App

## Project Title and Description

This project, "Streamlit Lab," is an interactive web application built using Streamlit. It provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and visualizing datasets, performing basic data analysis, and creating interactive charts and visualizations.  The application aims to streamline the data analysis process by offering a readily accessible platform for exploring data without requiring extensive coding.  It supports various data formats and includes features for filtering, sorting, and visualizing data in meaningful ways.  The primary goal is to empower users, even those with limited programming experience, to gain valuable insights from their data.

## Features

*   **Data Upload:**  Supports uploading data from various sources, including CSV, Excel (xlsx, xls), and potentially other formats (JSON, etc.) in future iterations.
*   **Data Display:**  Presents uploaded data in an interactive, sortable table format.
*   **Data Filtering:** Allows users to filter data based on column values, enabling focused analysis on specific subsets.
*   **Data Summary:** Provides descriptive statistics for numerical columns, such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max.
*   **Interactive Charts:** Generates various interactive charts, including:
    *   **Histograms:** Visualizes the distribution of numerical data.
    *   **Scatter Plots:** Explores relationships between two numerical variables.
    *   **Bar Charts:** Compares categorical data.
    *   (Expand as features are added)
*   **Customizable Visualizations:**  Allows users to customize chart parameters such as titles, axis labels, colors, and chart types.
*   **Downloadable Charts:** Enables users to download generated charts in various formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, SVG).
*   **Data Cleaning (Basic):**  Includes features to handle missing values (e.g., removal, imputation). (Planned, implement in later versions)
*   **Data Transformation (Basic):** Includes features to allow renaming of columns. (Planned, implement in later versions)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:**  Python 3.7 or higher is recommended.  You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **pip:** Python's package installer. Usually comes with Python installations.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):** If you have the code in a git repository, clone it using:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**  This helps isolate project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv  # or python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**  Use `pip` to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If you don't have a `requirements.txt` yet, you can create one by tracking your dependencies as you install them or manually create it with the libraries used in the streamlit application. For example:
    ```txt
    streamlit
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    plotly
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py  # Replace app.py with the name of your Streamlit script
    ```

2.  **Access the application in your browser:**  Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your terminal. Open this URL in your web browser to access the application.

3.  **Using the Application:**
    *   **Upload Data:** Click the "Browse files" button or drag and drop a CSV or Excel file into the designated area.
    *   **View Data:** The uploaded data will be displayed in a table.
    *   **Filter Data:** Use the filter options above each column to narrow down the data. Type in a value and press enter to filter.
    *   **Generate Charts:** Select the type of chart you want to generate from the sidebar.  Specify the columns for the x-axis and y-axis.  Click the "Generate Chart" button to display the chart.
    *   **Customize Charts:** Adjust the chart title, axis labels, and other parameters in the sidebar.
    *   **Download Charts:** Click the download button below the chart to save it as a PNG image.

*   `app.py`:  This is the heart of the application, containing the Streamlit code that defines the user interface and functionality.
*   `requirements.txt`:  This file lists all the Python packages required to run the application.  It's used by `pip` to install the dependencies.
*   `data/`:  This directory (optional) can contain sample data files that users can experiment with.  It's good practice to include sample data for demonstration purposes.
*   `README.md`:  This file provides information about the project, including how to install, run, and use it.
*  `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
