## AI Risk Score - V4-2: Career Path Diversification Tool

In an era of rapid technological advancement, particularly with the rise of Artificial Intelligence,
understanding and managing career risk has become paramount. This **QuLab** application is designed to help you
assess your personal and professional exposure to AI-driven job displacement and explore strategies
to enhance your career resilience.

### Key Concepts:

*   **Idiosyncratic Risk ($V_i(t)$)**: Your individual vulnerability to job displacement. It's influenced by
    factors within your direct control (skills, education, experience, upskilling efforts).
    This is the risk specific to *you*.

    The formula for Idiosyncratic Risk is:
    $$
    V_i(t) = \min(100.0, \max(5.0, V_{raw} - 50.0))
    $$
    Where $V_{raw}$ combines Human Capital, Company, and Upskilling Factors.

*   **Systematic Risk ($H_i$)**: The broader, macro-level automation hazard inherent to your occupation or industry.
    It's influenced by external factors like economic climate ($M_{econ}$) and AI innovation ($IAI$).
    This is the risk that affects *everyone* in your field.

    The formula for Systematic Risk is:
    $$
    H_i = H_{base}(t) \cdot (w_{econ} M_{econ} + w_{inno} IAI)
    $$
    Where $H_{base}(t)$ is the Base Occupational Hazard for the occupation.

*   **"Education is Insurance"**: This concept illustrates how continuous learning and strategic career
    planning can act as a form of "career insurance" against AI displacement. By managing your risk factors,
    you effectively reduce your potential "insurance premium" against job loss.

    Your **Monthly Insurance Premium ($P_{monthly}$)** is derived from your **Annual Expected Loss ($E[Loss]$)**:
    $$
    P_{monthly} = \max \left( \frac{E[Loss] \cdot \lambda}{12}, P_{min} \right)
    $$
    Where $\lambda$ is the loading factor and $P_{min}$ is the minimum premium.
